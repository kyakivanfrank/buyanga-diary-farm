    "article":"Keeping cattle is a time-honored cultural tradition in western Uganda, where the iconic long-horned animals are associated with royalty—and valued for far more than the milk they produce. But as families shift to commercial farming to meet the nation’s steadily rising demand for milk, many of them need advice on techniques that will help fortify milk production. Joseph Nsereko, a farmer in Mbarara, used to be one of those farmers looking for support. He struggled to increase milk production to beyond 180 liters per day from a dairy herd of around 30 cows. Pearl Dairy, a milk processor that depends on local farmers for a sustainable, steady supply of milk, reached out to train Nsereko. With Pearl Dairy’s guidance—including direct engagement and access to regular agricultural extension services—he doubled his farm’s daily raw milk output",

      "article":"It was first estimated that livestock contributed 1.7 percent to total national GDP in 2009. That estimate was later revised to about 3.2 percent. By 2014, that contribution had risen to 9 percent of national GDP. The cattle kept are predominantly indigenous breeds, accustomed to the weather and husbandry practices as practiced by the herder communities, conditions that many exotic breeds could not withstand. Exotic breeds have been introduced, but the majority of farms have mixed breeds, whose productivity, although higher than the traditional breeds, does not match that of the exotics.",
